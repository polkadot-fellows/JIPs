# JAM Improvement Proposals

- [JIP-2](./JIP-2.md): **Node RPC** - RPC specification for JAM nodes to ensure JAM tooling which relies on being an RPC client is implementation-agnostic. 
- [JIP-3](./JIP-3.md): **Telemetry** - Specification for JAM node telemetry allowing integration into JAM Tart (Testing, Analytics and Research Telemetry).
- [JIP-4](./JIP-4.md): **Chainspec file** - A chain specification collects information that describes a JAM-based network.
- [JIP-5](./JIP-5.md): **Secret key derivation** - A standard method for deriving a set of validator secret keys from a 32-byte seed.
